After you’ve sat on it for a few days, you’ll never want to go back to your old way of sitting.
Designed by Peter Opsvik in 1979, Variable balans is the original kneeling chair. A Varier classic, the seat gently tilts the pelvis forward and encourages a natural, dynamic and upright spine.
The muscles in the abdomen and back engage to keep the spine upright and the body balanced, which strengthens core muscles and prevents back and shoulder tension.
The angle between the upper and lower body increases, greatly improving circulation.
As the body moves from an active to a relaxed posture, the flexible runners respond with a gentle pendular motion.
An optional backrest provides further support, if necessary.
